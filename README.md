## Description 

This is a fully responsive portfolio page for future work projects to be showcased to employers and anyone wanting to view my work. This is a static page made with HTML and CSS. 

The motivation to build this project is to learn the skills to build webpages and style them.

i learned a lot about CSS styling and that I probably have a long way to go before this becomes second nature. 

## Installation

All that is needed is to git pull this to your local server, open with a text editor and view it in default browser
